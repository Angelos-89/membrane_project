A Monte Carlo algorithm written in C++, to calculate the effective
elastic coefficients of a membrane in thermal equilibrium with
its environment.

Three cases can be studied.

a) Unpinned-free membrane.

b) Pinned membrane with individual degrees of freedom being pinned.

c) Block-pinned membrane with regions of desired radius being pinned.
   In this case, interconnected pinned regions may arise.
